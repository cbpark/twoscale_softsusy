  This table provides the user with a possibility to choose distributions,
which will be filled during the Monte Carlo sessions.
  The tested value must be described in the first column. It is defined by
a key character and a particle set following this character. For example, 
"C13" means cosine of angle between the first and the third particles.
  The following key characters are available:
  A  - Angle  in degree unit
  C  - Cosine of angle   
  J  - Jet cone angle    
  E  - Energy of the particle set
  M  - Mass of the particle set 
  P  - Cosine in the rest frame of particles. 
  T  - Transverse momentum P_t  of the particle set 
  S  - Squared mass
  Y  - Rapidity of particle set.
  N  - Pseudo-rapidity of particle set.
  U  - user defined function 
See Manual for details.
  The second and the third columns are used to define a range of the
distribution. The ranges may be described by an algebraic formula 
which contains numbers and CalcHEP identifiers.
