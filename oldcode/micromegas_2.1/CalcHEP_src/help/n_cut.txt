  This table  apples cuts on the phase space. A phase space function
is described in the first column. Its limits are defined and the second
and the third columns. If one of these fields is empty then a one-side
cut is applied. 
  The phase space function is defined by a key character and a particle
set following this character without separators. For example, "C13" 
means cosine of angle between the first and the third particles.
  The following key characters are available:
  A  - Angle  in degree units;
  C  - Cosine of angle;
  J  - Jet cone angle;
  E  - Energy of the particle set;
  M  - Mass of the particle set;
  P  - Cosine in the rest frame of pair;
  T  - Transverse momentum P_t  of the particle set;
  S  - Squared mass of the particle set;
  Y  - Rapidity of  particle set. 
  N  - Pseudo-rapidity of particle set.
  U  - user implemented function.
See manual for details.

 The parameter  limits van be defined  by an algebraic formula, which 
contains numbers and identifiers enumerated in the "Model parameters" 
menu. Parentheses  "()" and  operation "+,-,/,*,**,sqrt()" are also 
permitted.
