This directory does not present a physical model.
It contains  auxiliary  codes and models which where 
used to prepare micrOMEGAs_2.1. In particular
1) calchep/ directory contains toy models which allow to check 
    a) a model with  basic operators;
    b) a model with twist-2 operator;
    c) a model with WINP-quark-squark  Yukawa interaction
2) work/models contains a toy model which allow to check s-quark 
co-annihilation. In particular one can see that if Msq-Mlsp <10 GeV then 
co-annihilation ~q,~Q -> G,G puts Relic below WMAP. In its turn it means 
that twist-2 and box diagrams are not so important in direct detection
business.
   main.c and data1.par are tools to play with this toy model. 

3)I1test.c gives a possibility to check a factor which comes from box
diagrams. It demonstrates that  this factor is about [1- 0.5*Mq/(Msq-Mne)].
Compile it by 
        make main=I1test.c
Usage 
       ./I1test Mq Msq Mne
4) cFermi.c - extract Fermi half density from  data of momenta of 
proton density. 
5) sdFermi.c finds  Fermi half density  for spin dependent interactions
6) sd_comp.tab.c compare results obtained by Fermi density and against  one 
   obtained with special SD form factors.
