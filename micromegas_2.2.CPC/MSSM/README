2.=================== Spectrum Calculation ======================
By default we use SuSpect-2.40 for RGE solution and calculation of particle spectrum.
To use other RGE codes: SPHENO, SOFTSUSY,ISAJET, the user has to define  
the corresponding variables in lib/Makefile.
These variables have to contain the path to the corresponding package. 
For example, 
    SOFTSUSY=$HOME/softsusy 
In all cases we use the SLHA file interface to pass the data.
 
In the case of ISAJET, one has to make some modifications for SLHA interface. 
For this goal one has to define path to Isajet package  and CERNLIB.
It should be done via ISAJET and CERNLIB variables defined in 
lib/Makefile. After that go to 'lib' subdirectory and call
    make  isajet_slha
The file isajet_slha  has to appear in the same directory.
 
3. Example files cycle2.c and cycle5.c  are test programs which
should reproduce Table_2 and Table_5 presented in the article.
mssm1.par is a file with EWSB parameters which is called from cycle2.c.
main.c and main.F demonstrate general facilities of micrOMEGAs.
