HOW TO USE NMSSMTOOLS:

After the download of NMSSMTools_x.tgz (where x is the version
number), type "tar zxvf NMSSMTools_x.tgz". This will create a directory
named NMSSMTools_x.
Go into this directory. 
There you find the directories 
-- "sources", "main" and "micromegas_2.0", which contain source files;
-- "EXPCON", which contains data files corresponding to experimental
    constraints;
-- "SAMPLES", which contains sample input and output files; 
-- "BMPSUGRA" contains mSUGRA-like benchmark points as in
    A. Djouadi et al., arXiv:0801.4321 [hep-ph];
-- "BMPGMSB" contains GMSB-like benchmark points as in  
    U. Ellwanger et al., arXiv:0803.2962 [hep-ph].
    
COMPILATION:
    
To compile, type first "make init", then "make". A first compilation
may take a while, since all subroutines of micromegas_2.0 are compiled.
The following 8 executable routines are created in the directory
"main": nmhdecay, nmhdecay_rand, nmhdecay_grid, nmspec, nmspec_rand,
nmspec_grid, nmgmsb and nmgmsb_rand.
If a subroutine in the directory "sources" was modified, one has to
type "make init" and "make" again. If a routine in the directory "main"
was modified, it suffices to type "make" again.
To delete all the already compiled codes type "make clean".

INPUT FILES:

From the version 2.0.0 onwards, the task to be performed by an input
file is independent from its name. Any name is allowed, provided it
contains the three letters "inp"; it can be of the general form
PREFIXinpSUFFIX where PREFIX and SUFFIX can contain dots etc..

The input file can be located in any directory specified by a PATH.

To run any input file PREFIXinpSUFFIX, type "run PATH/PREFIXinpSUFFIX".
(PATH is optional; if absent, the input file has to be located in the
same directory as the script file "run".)

The output files are located in the directory specified by PATH.
They have the following format: 
If one single point in the parameter space is evaluated:
   PREFIXspectrSUFFIX, PREFIXdecaySUFFIX, PREFIXomegaSUFFIX (if the
   relic density is computed, see below)
If scans are performed:
   PREFIXerrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXoutSUFFIX 

However, the task to be performed by an input file must be specified in
the BLOCK MODSEL at the beginning (see the SLHA2 conventions in 
B. Allanach et al., SUSY Les Houches Accord 2, arXiv:0801.0045
[hep-ph]).

The BLOCK MODSEL should contain the following four lines:

BLOCK MODSEL
	3	1		# NMSSM PARTICLE CONTENT
	1	I1		# IMOD (0=general NMSSM, 1=mSUGRA, 2=GMSB)
	10	I2		# ISCAN (0=NO SCAN, 1=GRID, 2=RANDOM)
	9	I3		# FLAG FOR MICROMEGAS (0=NO, 1=YES)

The meaning of the three integers I1, I2 and I3 is as follows:

I1=0: general NMSSM with parameters specified at the SUSY breaking scale
      (an average of the squark masses, unless specified by the user).
      As in the previous versions of NMSSMTools, the input parameters
      have to be given in the BLOCK EXTPAR following the SLHA2
      conventions. 
      Exceptions are as follows:
      -- The running CP-odd Higgs-doublet mass MA can be specified in
      the entry 124; then the parameter A_lambda (entry 63) must be
      omitted.
      -- The soft squark and slepton masses and trilinear couplings of
      the first two generations do not have to be specified; then they
      are identical to those of the third generation. If desired,
      the soft squark and slepton masses and trilinear couplings of
      the first two generations can be specified separately. However,
      the first two generations cannot be treated differently.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inp.dat.

I1=1: mSUGRA-like boundary conditions at the GUT scale with universal
      scalar masses M0, gaugino masses M12 and trilinear couplings A0
      (to be specified in the BLOCK MINPAR).
      Optionally, the following parameters can be chosen 
      non-universally: A_kappa, A_lambda, the soft Higgs masses MHD and
      MHU (the soft singlet mass and kappa are always determined by
      tan(beta) and M_Z), and any of the gaugino masses M1, M2 and M3.
      See the example in SAMPLES/inpsp.dat.

I1=2: GMSB-like boundary conditions as in the paper U. Ellwanger et al.,
      arXiv:0803.2962 [hep-ph]. Note that either the soft singlet mass
      squared MS (entry 70) or the SUSY breaking tadpole term XiS
      (entry 67) can be specified; see the corresponding examples in
      SAMPLES/inpgm.dat.1 and SAMPLES/inpgm.dat.2.

I2=0: One single point in parameter space is evaluated. Detailed
      informations on the spectrum, mixing angles, the satisfaction of
      theoretical and experimental constraints are given in the output
      file PREFIXspectrSUFFIX, detailed informations on the partial
      decay widths of all six Higgs states in PREFIXdecaySUFFIX.
      
I2=1: A scan over a grid in parameter space is performed. The
      boundaries in parameter space as well as the corresponding
      numbers of steps have to be specified. 
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/gridinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/gridinpsp.dat.
      Scans on grids with GMSB-like boundary conditions are not yet
      possible (in contrast to random scans, see below).
      
      The output file PREFIXerrSUFFIX gives the number of points which
      have passed all constraints, and the corresponding range of input
      parameters.
      The output file PREFIXoutSUFFIX contains details of points which
      have passed constraints; the latter can be modified by the user
      by editing the corresponding routines in the directory "main":
      
      The output file PREFIXoutSUFFIX is created in the subroutine
      OUTPUT near the end of the file nmhdecay_grid.f (general NMSSM)
      or nmspec_grid.f (mSUGRA). 
      If the first line in the subroutine OUTPUT reads
      "IF(IFAIL.EQ.0)THEN", properties of points with phenomenological
      problems are not written into PREFIXoutSUFFIX.
      If this line reads "IF(IFAIL.EQ.0 .OR. IFAIL.EQ.10)THEN", points
      with phenomenological problems are written as well. 
      The properties which are listed in PREFIXoutSUFFIX depend on the
      second argument of the array RES(IDIM,I) and should be specified
      by the user.
      The meaning of the various arrays containing Higgs and sparticle
      masses and mixing angles as well as Higgs branching ratios is
      given at the beginning of the file nmhdecay_grid.f (general
      NMSSM) or nmspec_grid.f (mSUGRA). For convenience, we list the
      content of the array PAR(I) (the couplings and soft terms at the
      SUSY scale) as well as the content of the array PROB(I)
      (phenomenological and some theoretical constraints) below.

I2=3: A random scan in parameter space is performed. The boundaries in
      parameter space as well as the total number of steps have to be
      specified. 
      For possible scans in the general NMSSM see the example
      SAMPLES/randinp.dat.
      For possible scans with mSUGRA-like boundary conditions see the
      example SAMPLES/randinpsp.dat.
      For possible scans with GMSB-like boundary conditions see the
      examples SAMPLES/randinpgm.dat.1 and SAMPLES/randinpgm.dat.2.
      
      For the content of the output files PREFIXerrSUFFIX and
      PREFIXoutSUFFIX (and the treatment of the latter) see the
      description of the case I2=2 above; the corresponding MAIN
      routines for random scans in the directory "main" are denoted by
      nmhdecay_rand.f, nmspec_rand.f and nmgmsb_rand.f.
      
I3=0: The dark matter relic density is not computed.

I3=1: The dark matter relic density is computed and checked via a call
      of micromegas_2. (This option is not possible for GMSB-like
      boundary conditions. A first call of micromegas provokes the
      compilation of additional subroutines, which may take a while.)
      
      In the case of a single point in parameter space (I2=0), the
      relic density Omega*h^2 is given in the output files
      PREFIXspectrSUFFIX as well as PREFIXomegaSUFFIX. The latter
      contains in addition informations on the decomposition of the LSP
      and the relevant annihilation/coannihilation processes.
